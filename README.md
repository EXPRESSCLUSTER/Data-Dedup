# Data Deduplication with EXPRESSCLUSTER X
A file server often will have redundant files stored across its volume. Data Deduplication can optimize free space by identifying duplicated portions of a volume and optimizing redundancies. For a good overview of Data Deduplication, why it is useful, and when it can be used, please see this [Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/data-deduplication/overview). Data Deduplication is available for Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019 on NTFS volumes. This document looks at using Data Deduplication on an EXPRESSCLUSTER mirror disk and shared disk.
